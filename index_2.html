      <p class="history_text">The history of Violets doesn't have one line, so here is what we found </p>
      <p class="history_text">Originally, the flowers of Violet were known ever since the ancient Greek time or around 500 B.C. Greeks and Romans believed that this flower was useful as herbal remedies from different illnesses and sicknesses.Ancient Romans made violet wine and stew them on floors to make the air pleasant.</p>
      <p class="history_text_w">And here you can read the myths, tales, made by different folks</p>
      <p class="history_text">The Violet flower meaning is replete with some religious/cultural connotations and interesting stories. From Christianity, the flower is given the title viola odorata, which can be interpreted as “our lady of modesty,” which Roman Catholics used to define Mary’s humility and her devotion to the religion. The story says that the flower grew when angel Gabriel broke the news of her conception. The significance of this story to some makes them see it as a sacred flower.</p>
      <p class="history_text">Greco-Roman myth tells us of Cybele’s love for Attis.The boy, whose name was Attis, was unaware of the love Cybele bore him. In time, Attis saw the king of Pessinus' beautiful daughter, fell in love, and wished to marry her. The goddess Cybele became insanely jealous and drove Attis mad as revenge. Running crazy through the mountains, Attis stopped at the foot of a pine tree. There Attis castrated and killed himself. From Attis' blood sprang the first violets.</p>
      <p class="history_text">A third story from Greece claims that Zeus had a hankering for a lovely woman named Io (whose name happens to mean Violet). Out of fear of Hera’s vengeful jealousy he turned Io into a cow and made her a field of never ending sweet violets to eat for all eternity.</p>
      <p class="history_text">Not to be outdone, Romans also had a story about Violets that begins with an argument between Venus and Cupid. Venus asked who was more beautiful, her or a group of girls. Cupid feeling uppity said the girls. Venus became enraged and beat the girls, their blue bruises becoming violets.</p>
      <p class="history_text">Finally in Iroquois folklore there’s a story of a great warrior who was known for his amazing feats of valor. One day in his travels he spied a beautiful woman who he wanted to make his own, but could not because of tribal rivalry. In an effort to turn fate’s tide he gave up fighting and spent all his time singing of the woman’s many attributes. The birds heard the song, as did Beaver, Bear and Fox. The birds started singing too and the woman finally came out from her tribe as a willing captive. The rival tribe was enraged and hunted the two down to their deaths. Where their bodies lay in the forest, violets blossomed and remain a symbol of constant love to this day.</p>
